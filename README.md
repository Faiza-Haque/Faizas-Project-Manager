# Project-Manager

## Description

* I wanted to create a Task Board application that tracks your prajects with a title, description, and the date is is due by using a thrid-party APIs like jQueri, Bootstrap, Day.js and as well as addEventListener, localStorage, JSON.parse and JSON.stringify. All of these code and articles helped in creating my application. 

* There was a starter code given which I then modified necessary to my goal

* I discovered the following:
- Bootstap components that have Modals and Forms
- jQuery Interactions Draggable and Droppable
- jQuery Widget Datepicker and Day.js
- Adding dates using jQuery Widget Datepicker and Day.js
